                <h1>Victoria's Escalating Property and Rental Prices: Navigating a Shifting Housing Landscape</h1>
                <p>The surging property and rental prices in Victoria have been characterized by a relentless upward
                    trajectory, as demand continues to outpace supply. Over the past several years, prospective
                    homeowners and renters have witnessed a steady climb in property values and lease rates,
                    resulting in an increasingly competitive and cost-prohibitive real estate market. This
                    unrelenting surge in prices has left many individuals and families grappling with affordability
                    challenges, reshaping the housing landscape in the region.</p>

                        further away they go from central Melbourne. The following map shows the median rental prices by
                        local government area.

                <p>Here, we see that the exponential rise in property prices in Australia has been occuring for at least
                    the past
                    twenty years. According to the data, the median price of a house cost less than a third in 2000 than
                    it did in 2016. </p>

                <p> The following chart provides a summary of the affordability of rental housing for lower
                    incomehouseholds in Victoria.The method used in this section measures the supply of affordable new
                    lettings based on the
                    Residential Tenancies Bond
                    Authority data used in this Report. The affordability benchmark used is that no more than 30 per
                    cent of gross income is
                    spent on rent. Lower income households are defined as those receiving Centrelink incomes. From this,
                    we are able to see which areas in Victoria are more likely to have affordable housing. Here, as you
                    slide the affordability slider towards 100%, you can see which areas have attainable lodgings. Only
                    around a quarter of local government areas have half or more affordable rent.</p>

                <p> This donut chart compares the ratio of homeless people in the entirety of Australia as compared to
                    just Victoria. Comparing the rate of homelessness taken from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in
                    2016 and Census of the same year, we see there are a whopping 31,552 people homeless, around a
                    quarter of all homeless people in Australia. Whilst Australia's property crisis is attributed to
                    many complex, external variables, it is likely that the affordability of housing is a significant
                    contributor to Victorians struggling to find housing. </p>
